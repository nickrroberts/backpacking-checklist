* Quick-drying hiking pants
* Camping chair --I'd highly recommend getting a sleeve like [this](http://www.exped.com/norway/en/product-category/mats/chair-kit-m) for your air mattress that lets it fold into a chair. Absolutely rocked my world when I got one.
* 0.5 - 1 liter of whiskey or wine (for the cold)

## Just in case
* One pack of freeze dried food
* First aid kit (bandages, antibacterial ointments, tweezers, aspirin, bone saw)
